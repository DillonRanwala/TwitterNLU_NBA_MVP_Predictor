# TwitterNLU_NBA_MVP_Predictor
This project explores the impact of media influence on NBA MVP voting with a variety of machine learning algorithms.

First to collect media sentiment, I used the Twint library to scrape tweets from NBA media accounts that mentioned certain MVP candidates.

Next, Emotion and Sentiment values were gathered for each tweet using two open source NLU models.

Using a combination of NBA statistics and NLU features, this project explored both classification and regression tasks for predicting NBA MVPs.

Data containing tweets, NLU data, and nba mvp statistics can be found in the data folder.
